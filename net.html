PowerPoint offers word processing, outlining, drawing, graphing, and presentation management tools- all designed to be easy to use and learn.

    In addition to slides, you can print audience handouts, outlines, and speaker's notes.

    You can format all the slides in a presentation using the powerful Slide Master which will be covered in the tutorial.

    You can keep your entire presentation in a single file- all your slides, speaker's notes, and audience handouts.

    You can import what you have created in other Microsoft products, such as Word and Excel into any of your slides.

In simple terms, freelancing is when you use your skills, education, and experience to work with multiple clients and take on various assignments without committing to a single employer. The number of assignments or tasks that you can take just boils down to your ability to deliver on them as asked from them.<a href="#">Redmore...</a></h3></a></p>
